## Project Description
This is a C++ console-based application that simulates a **Savings Account Management System**.  
The program allows users to track **monthly deposits, withdrawals, and tax deductions**, and calculates the **final account balance** over a user-defined period.  

It demonstrates the use of **arrays, functions, loops, and input validation** to solve a real-world financial problem.

## Features
- Input starting balance and number of months the account has been active
- Input annual tax rate for deductions
- Track monthly deposits and withdrawals
- Calculate monthly tax deductions based on current balance
- Display final balance, total deposits, total withdrawals, and total tax deducted
- Input validation to prevent negative numbers or invalid data
